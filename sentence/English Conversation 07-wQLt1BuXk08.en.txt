well, will your product be very expensive or will it be cheap? 
expensive or cheap? well, our product cost is a little high but don't forget you will have more production and better quality. so you will not lose money. 
but how much will it cost? 
well, that depends on how much you order. if you order a lot, the cost will be a little lower. 
and if I order a little bit. 
if you order only a little bit, the cost will be higher. 
so how much does it cost? 
well, one bottle of our product costs about $20.
Oh Mark. that's very expensive. 
but don't forget we can negotiate the price.
you mean I can bargain with you. 
yes, and I can discount the price for you.
Great. 
but I knew you would say that. 
but you must order a lot to get a good price.
and if I order just a little bit. 
I said before the price will be high. 
and what are the terms of payment. 
well, you have a one-year contract. 
okay and you can make one large payment or you can divide into monthly payments. 
let's see. I would much rather pay by month. 
no problem. 
that's ok. 
how much will 500 bottles cost per month?
500 bottles? okay. let's see. there you go. how's that? 
that's not bad. 
But.this is better. 
ah. you can buy our product at this price only if you buy one thousand bottles.
600. 
850.
700.
750.
it's a deal. 
okay? 
well, you are very good at bargaining, mark. 
well, you can negotiate the price very well also, Tim.
thank you. 
well, I guess everything is finished then. 
okay, I know you will be very happy with our product. 
I hope I can agree with you. but if there are any problems I have your guarantee. 
yes, you have my guarantee. if you have any problems, please call me and I will come to help you.
